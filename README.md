Sorting Algorithms Answered
For this assignment you will be coding 6 different sorts: selection sort, cocktail shaker sort, merge sort, quick sort, LSD radix sort, and heap sort. In addition to the requirements for each sort, to test for efficiency, we will be looking at the number of comparisons made between elements while grading.

For each of the sorting algorithms, you may assume that the arrays you are sorting will not contain null. You should also assume that arrays may contain any number of duplicate elements.

Your implementations must match what was taught in lecture and recitation to receive credit. Implementing a different sort or a different implementation for a sort will receive no credit even if it passes comparison checks.

Comparator

Each method (except radix and heap sort) will take in a Comparator and use it to compare the elements of the array in various algorithms described below and in the sorting file. Youmust use this Comparator as the number of comparisons performed with it will be used when testing your assignment. See the Java API for details about how the Comparator works and the meaning of the returned value.
